Cabin Porn It
==========

Set the current screen to a cabin from CabinPorn.com.

Default is set to the most recent picture, which it downloads and puts into a
folder in the current directory.

To run: `python cabin-porn-it.py`.

_Requires_: Python 2.7+, Mac OSX Mavericks

Possible arguments:  

  * '-r', choose a random image from the current page  
  * 'path=BASE_DIR', choose a directory for the photos to be put into  

This is a very simple script. It sets the current picture. It doesn't look through the CP archives. It only works on Mac OSX Mavericks. It does not run itself, although setting a cron job up is totally possible. I just wanted a way to do this automatically. PRs accepted but not expected.
